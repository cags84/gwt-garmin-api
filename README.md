Just Started
============

I'm starting this to have an easy way to access Garmin watch data clientside. I'm in the research stage to determine if other GPS watch vendors have web API's, but Polar, Soleus, Timex and Nike are all closed source OS specifc binaries. None offer browser plugins but Garmin, so Garmin it is for the time being.
